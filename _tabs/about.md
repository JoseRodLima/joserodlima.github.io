Greetings! My name is Pedro, and I am a passionate Cybersecurity enthusiast.

I enjoy diving into various aspects of the field, including blue team and red team activities, among others. I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Network Security and am eager to keep expanding my knowledge and skills in this ever-evolving area.

This GitHub page was created to showcase my work and achievements.

One of the main platforms I use for practicing and learning cybersecurity is TryHackMe. You can visit my profile by clicking on the image below.
